1.Queue
A queue is a data structure in which only the earliest added element is accessed.
New elements are added to the end of the queue and removed from the front of the queue.
The STL has a special queue container that implements this functionality.
To use it, you need to include the queue header file:
2.Makefile
   make-We create an executable file with the make command
   make run - Run the executable file with the make run command
   make clean - With the make clean command, we delete all o extension files and executable files
